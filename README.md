> PROD [Live] : https://react-usereducer-cart-prod.netlify.app/

#### Cart consists of a straightforward user interface where there is a

- List of some of the items added to the cart, **Navbar** with the title *useReducer* , **cart amount** i.e. total number of items added by default, and a **`CLEAR CART`** button to clear all items in the cart which on click shows `YOUR BAG is currently empty`.
- Each cartItem has the `image` , `title` , `price` , `amount`, along with a few buttons i.e. **`remove`** to remove the item from the cart, ðŸ”¼ to increase , ðŸ”½ to decrease the amount of that particular item and when the item amount gets less than 1, it is automatically removed from the cart.  
- For every change in cartItem, the **total price** and **cart amount** gets adjusted.  
- **`Loading...`** will be shown while fetching data, once the data is available cart will be shown. 
- Data is handled by **`data.js`** , **`API`**, and styles are handled by **`index.css`**
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm start` to start up the development server on default port 3000.
